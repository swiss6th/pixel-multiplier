# Pixel Multiplier

Pixel Multiplier is a utility to take an arbitrary number of RGB pixel values (3 DMX channels each) and multiply them live. It is written in Python and requires Open Lighting Architecture.

## Setup

All you have to do is specify which DMX universes and channels you want as sources and which you want as destinations.
